# Brief

**Due Week 11 , 16th October 2017, 9 am**
The code for the project, plus a readme file  with installation and basic usage instructions.
**Due Week 12, 27th October 2015, 5 pm**
Final version of the project plus a report which discusses the functionality, development and evaluation of the project.
*NB, The class will be involved in the finalising of the requirements and assessment of the project.* 

# **Tātai! Te Reo Maths Aid**

The project will involve developing a tool to provide real-time feedback on being able to do **basic maths**, with the **answers given in spoken Māori**. 
You will be using JAVA to create the user interface, Linux system calls to process the media files from the JAVA app, and the HTK speech recognition tools to do speech assessment. 
Whilst the actual coding and design of the tool will take place in the latter part of the semester, 
preparation for the project has actually been from the beginning of the course. Table 1 below outlines the development process of the project.

# **Project**

The development of Tātai! will be done in pairs. The project involves creating a **basic Maths aid.** 


- Math problems are presented, user works out the answer and says it in Māori. 
- The **answers** to the maths problems must always be integers between 0 and 99. 
- Scores are taken for each list of expressions
  - Personal score history for each user is kept
  - as well as a record for the **best overall score**. 
- The problem list is compiled depending on the users’ ability. 
- The aid will have the **ability to use both previously prepared lists**
  - also enable a user to **input their own problem list.** 

**The features of the aid will include**

  - A well designed graphical user interface
  - **Help** on how to use the different features of the tool
  - A **practise module**, where users can practise saying the Māori numbers
  - Speech playback, so users can hear their latest attempt.
  - **Some form of Reward**, to motivate the user (this could potentially be the scoring mechanism listed below).
  - A scoring mechanism, including notification of personal bests, and over highest scores.
  - **It must run on Linux.**

**Target Audience**
When you design the aid you will need to keep the target user in mind, this will have a direct impact on the GUI which is the actual spelling interface. 

**You need to choose one of the following three target user options:**

1. **A child user,** aged 7-10, who is a first language speaker of Māori, and they will be using the aid to improve their maths
2. **A second language learner**, young adult (18-25 yrs), they will be using the aid to improve their Māori pronunciation. 
3. **An elderly user**, as a game option on our Health-bot Robot, they will be using the aid to improve their Māori pronunciation.

**Design Decisions**
There are many choices you can make in regards to the graphical user-interface, and also in terms of how the information is displayed. Think carefully about these as you will be asked to justify them in the accompanying report. For instance you will need to consider the window design, the choice of colours for both the background and the plots. What kinds of menus are you going to offer the user, and what about button design? Will you have key short cuts? These are only a few of the decisions you will be making. What ever your decisions it is important to discuss these fully and justify them in your report.

**Tātai! - The report details**
Accompanying the code will be a report (approx 10-12 pages). Everyone will write their own report. The intended reader of this report will be the chief technical officer, who will be assessing whether your program, the Tātai!, is potential candidate for a marketable product. There is no need for you to address any marketing issues. The

**report will need to contain**

    1. A u**ser manua**l for Tātai!
    2. **Information about the features** of Tātai!: 
    1. highlighting the **design decisions** made (*for example the design on the Tester and Maths Answer interfaces*) 
    2. what is used for the graphics
    3. what was the **reason behind the choice of colours**, etc. Be sure to justify all the approaches taken.
    3. Details about who the **intended users** of Tātai! might be.
    4. **Details about the Software Development process**, for example: how was version control dealt with? how was the work load distributed?, what would you do better next time? What worked well?
    5. Details about how Tātai! was evaluated; both self and peer, include here such things as:
    1. **comparisons to other systems** (in your class and in general)
    2. what **changes you would make** to your aid as a consequence of the peer evaluations, 
    3. and justify your reasons. 

You may decide no changes would be necessary, but you need to also justify these, also you should discuss what exactly has been evaluated and what has not.

**Use of external code or information.** 
You may occasionally use snippets of code or information from other sources if you wish, but you **MUST** indicate where you have done so and reference the original work. The majority of both the program code must be from your group. If you have included someone else’s work without clearly indicating each and every usage, we will have to assume the intent was to pass the work off as your own, and take appropriate action.

**Marking Schedule**
**Marks will be allocated for the project on**

  - Functionality of the aid
  - Code Quality
  - Code Documentation
  - Development Documentation (written in the journal)
  - Report
  - User Manual

We will release the actual marking schedule of the project in week 10, after a discussion with the class.
